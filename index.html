                Since 2020, at just 13 years old, working on his first single "All Left Behind", he only believed in 2024 that it would be the right time to expose his emotions. Singer and songwriter, pop artist Santiago Mianoe has a devotion to music. This passion arose from an early age, listening to songs by artists such as Billie Eilish and Lana Del Rey, who gave him the sensation of art flowing through his veins - giving him the feeling of wanting to live more, as if he felt so alive and appreciated his existence. Identifying music as a feeling, Santiago writes his compositions with all his heart, giving rise to scenarios in which music becomes the guiding thread to display his inner feelings and the emotions of the moment.
